# Led-Cybe-16-16
This project covers the design and construction of a 16×16×16 LED Cube comprising  4096 LEDs. It supports over 30 display patterns—including rain simulation, circular and  helical motions—using multiplex scanning and advanced software algorithms. Control is  handled by a PIC18F46K22 microcontroller. Mechanical design was done in SolidWorks
